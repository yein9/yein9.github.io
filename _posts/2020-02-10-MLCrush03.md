### (Supervised)Machine Learning?

ML systems learn how to combine input to produce useful predictions on never-before-seen data.

ML 시스템은 입력을 조합해  기존에 없던 데이터에 관한 유용한 예측을 하도록 학습한다.



### ML Terminology

- Labels : What we are predicting
- Features : input variable
- Examples :  Labeled {Feature, Label} / Unlabeled {Feature, ?}
- Model : A model defines the relationship between Features and Labels. 
- Training : Creating/Learning model using labeled data. 
- Inference : Applying the trained model to unlabeled examples. 
- Regression Model: Predicts Continuous value
- Classification Model: Predicts Discrete value
