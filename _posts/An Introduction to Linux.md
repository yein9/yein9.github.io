# An Introduction to Linux

### YOU are probably using Linux!

- Android is based on Linux (apple is not)

- wifi-router  OpenWRT (Non-Real-Time Linux based open source OS for wifi )

- Most sites are likely to use Linux - because it's open source!

- examples
  - LG - webOS
  - Samsung - Tizen

- Linux is mainstream OS!




## LINUX

### Terminology

RMS(who?)

refers to kernel

kernel?  controls hw for sw.

os VS kernel : OS contains kernel

Any distribution that uses linux



### Creation

why linux created?

Linus Torvalds  couldn't afford UNIX (UNIX-operating systems developed by Bell Lab)

Torvalds modified MINIX to be more capable



### Usage

**üëéReasons not to use it**

- less mainstream software support/availibity
- less mainstream  obscure hw support
- package-management based system : terminal



**üëçReasons to use Linux**

- Less virus& less vulnerable to security threats (sandbox application - not allow to touch os)
- why is Linux less vulnerable than others?  There are many watchers, send patches to the maintainer.  Because Linux is a open source, lots of companies use server that is made of Linux. So many companies worry about the problem caused by Linux.
- require much less hw specification than windows
- more privacy  than windows, macOS
- no forced update
- Free
- Linux get new updates/release first (mostly open sources)

  ex)Docker is native to linux
- Linux is standard for develop system
- Majority of web servers, embed systems are Linux (pay more for ms server)
